# üîß PayPal Sandbox Setup Guide

## ‚ùå Current Issue
Your sandbox credentials are returning: `"invalid_client"` - `"Client Authentication failed"`

This means the app needs proper configuration in PayPal Developer Dashboard.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Access PayPal Developer Dashboard
1. Go to: **https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/**
2. Log in with your PayPal account
3. Click **"Apps & Credentials"** in the top menu

### Step 2: Verify You're in Sandbox Mode
- Make sure you're on the **"Sandbox"** tab (NOT "Live")
- You should see your sandbox app listed

### Step 3: Check Your Sandbox App
1. Click on your app name to open settings
2. Verify these settings:

#### Required Settings:
- **App Status:** Should be **"Active"** (not disabled)
- **App Type:** Should be **"Merchant"** or **"Platform"**

#### Features (Must be enabled):
- ‚úÖ **Accept payments**
- ‚úÖ **Checkout**
- ‚úÖ **Vault** (optional but recommended)

#### Return URLs:
Add these URLs:
```
http://localhost:3000/trading
http://localhost:3000/trading?payment=success
http://localhost:3000/trading?payment=cancelled
```

### Step 4: Regenerate Credentials (If Needed)
If the app looks correct but still fails:

1. In your app settings, find **"Secret"**
2. Click **"Show"** to reveal it
3. Copy both:
   - **Client ID** (the long string starting with `A...`)
   - **Secret** (click "Show" first)
4. If there's a **"Generate New Secret"** button, click it to get fresh credentials

### Step 5: Update .env.local
Replace with the NEW credentials:

```bash
# PayPal Configuration (Sandbox for testing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_NEW_CLIENT_ID
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_NEW_SECRET
```

### Step 6: Test Again
```bash
node test-paypal-credentials.js
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Successfully authenticated with PayPal!
üéâ PayPal integration is ready to use!
```

2. **Enable features:**
   - ‚úÖ Accept payments
   - ‚úÖ Checkout

3. **Add Return URLs:**

## üéØ What Should Work

Once properly configured, you should be able to:

1. ‚úÖ Test credentials with `node test-paypal-credentials.js`
2. ‚úÖ Click "Upgrade to Pro" button
3. ‚úÖ See PayPal checkout window
4. ‚úÖ Complete payment with test card
5. ‚úÖ See success message

---

## üß™ Test Cards (Once Working)

Use these in PayPal sandbox:
- **Visa:** 4032039878215896
- **Mastercard:** 5425233430109903
- **Expiry:** Any future date (e.g., 12/2025)
- **CVV:** Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)

---

## üöÄ Moving to Production

Once sandbox testing works:

1. **Get Live Credentials:**
   - Switch to "Live" tab in PayPal Dashboard
   - Create a live app (same process)
   - Copy live Client ID and Secret

2. **Update .env.local:**
   ```bash
   # Uncomment these and comment out sandbox credentials
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<live_client_id>
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=<live_secret>
   ```

3. **Update API Base URL:**
   The code automatically switches to production URL when `NODE_ENV=production`

4. **Test with real money:**
   Use small amounts first ($0.01) to verify everything works
